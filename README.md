# Description
For this project we were tasked to design and develop a web page for the community science museum. Targeting ages 7-15 year olds. We were given text and images but colors, fonts and design was all up to us to create and design. I chose a color palette going for a dark theme but also with bright and vivid colors and for fonts I wanted to go a bit different so I paired Alegreya with Nunito with inspiration from the Figma community.
