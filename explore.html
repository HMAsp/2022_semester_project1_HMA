                You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?<br> Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.<br>
                We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you'll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.<br>
                During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore.<br> To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.
